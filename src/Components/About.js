                    As a web developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between
                    engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design
                    to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications
                    that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging,
                    beautiful user experiences.</p>
